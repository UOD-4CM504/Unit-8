# Exercise 8.1

Read the contents of ``example.txt`` and count the number of words in the file. Be warned that the file contains double and triple spaces.

HINT: You may wish to use the ``split()`` and ``strip()`` methods.

You should write your code in the ``count_words()`` function which should return the number of words in the file (``int``)

```python
def count_words(filename):
  """ Write your code here """
  pass

def main():
  print(count_words("example.txt")) # should print 15

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
